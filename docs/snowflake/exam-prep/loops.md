***

A `REPEAT` loop iterates <u>until a condition is true</u>. In a `REPEAT` loop, the condition is tested immediately after executing the body of the loop. As a result, the body of the loop always executes at least once.

A `WHILE` loop iterates <u>while a condition is true</u>. In a `WHILE` loop, the condition is tested immediately before executing the body of the loop. If the condition is false before the first iteration, then the body of the loop does not execute even once.
