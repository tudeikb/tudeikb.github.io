> A developer is granted ownership of a table that has a masking policy. The developer’s role is not able to see the masked data. Will the developer be able to modify the table to read the masked data?
>
> ✅ No, because ownership of a table does not include the ability to change masking policies.
>
> ❌ Yes, because a table owner has full control and can unset masking policies.
>
> ❌ Yes, because masking policies only apply to cloned tables. 
>
> ❌ No, because masking policies must always reference specific access roles.
